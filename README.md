# CT-GAN
This project is for reproducing the results of paper improving the improved wgans.
To test the generative model, please change to the tensorflow_generative_model forder (Tensorflow version: 1.2.1). To test the semi-supervised learning results please change to the Theano_classifier forder (Theano version:0.9.0).

For the generative model in MNIST dataset with 1000 data, please run: CT_gan_mnist.py. For the generative model in CIFAR-10 with 1000 data, run: CT_gan_cifar.py. And for the resnet version of CT_GAN, please run CT_gan_cifar_resnet.py.
To check some samples generated by our mrthod, please refer to the samples forder.

For the semi-supervised classification work, run CT-MNIST.py for 100 labeled MNIST training. run CT_CIFAR-10_TE.py for 4000 labeled CIFAR-10 training. The version of time consuming one is CT-CIFAR.py without temporal ensembling.
